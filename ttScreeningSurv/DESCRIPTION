Description: This function conducts a two step process for data with survival outcomes and high dimensional exposure variables
       The first step is a crude screening at a cutoff level, defined by users
       the second step is a ttScreening process, at a training significance level and a testing significance level with assinged number of iterations. 
       Argument
       Survivaldata is a dataframe which includes time status
       DNAm is a dataframe which includes high dimension
       Covariate_con=NULL multiple continuous covariates dataframe
       Covariate_cat=NULL multiple categorical covariates dataframe
       Cutoff.Joint=0.1 default cutoff level at the first step
       Iterations=100 default number of iterations
       Train.SigLevel=0.05 default significance level for a CpG to pass the training data screening
       Test.SigLevel=0.05 default significance level for a CpG to pass the testing data screening
       Percentage=0.50 default percentage level to pass ttScreening process
       Example
       ttscreening_surv(Survivaldata,DNAm,Covariate_con=Covariate_con_test,Covariate_cat=Covariate_cat_test, 
       Cutoff.Joint=0.1,Iterations=100,Train.SigLevel=0.05,Test.SigLevel=0.05,Percentage=0.01)
